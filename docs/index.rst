QCF: Estimating Quartet Concordance Factors
===========================================

QCF is a C++ program for estimating quartet concordance factors
from multilocus sequence data. It uses the theory of phylogenetic
invariants to calculate the frequency of gene tree quartets matching
the three possible unrooted species tree topologies for a set of four
taxa. QCF can handle multiple haplotypes per taxon/population,

SNaQ method `PhyloNetworks <http://crsl4.github.io/PhyloNetworks.jl/latest/>`__.
